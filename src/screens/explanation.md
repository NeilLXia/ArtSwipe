# The screens section

Right now, the organization scheme I'm going with is to just have naive tabs and screens.
It might be the case that it's better to redo tabs and screens into widges, where each
tab has its tab file and screens files together in their own separate folder. If I have to
restructure this would be the time to do it, so let me know.
